# **AI Programming with Python Projects**
This repository contains two projects developed as part of the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree under the AWS AI & ML Scholarship Program. Both projects focus on leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques for image classification tasks using Python and PyTorch.

## **üê∂ Project 1: Pretrained Model Evaluation for Pet Image Classification**
### Overview
The first project is an image classifier that identifies whether a participant in a City Dog Show is a dog and classifies the breed of the dog. This project uses VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet pretrained models to determine which model performs best at dog breed classification.

### Key Features
- Pretrained Model Evaluation: Compares the accuracy of VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet for classifying dog breeds.
- Results Dictionary: Stores pet labels, classifier labels, and misclassification details.
- Statistics Analysis: Generates accuracy and misclassification rates.
- Results Display: Implements functions to display and summarize model performance.

## **üå∏ Project 2: VGG-based Flower Species Image Classifier**
### Overview
This project implements a deep learning model using the VGG neural network architecture to classify different species of flowers. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune a pretrained model to predict flower types based on image inputs.

### Key Features
- VGG-based Neural Network: Fine-tuned using transfer learning for flower species classification.
- Scripts for Training and Prediction: Contains separate scripts for training (VGG or Resnet) models and predicting new images.
- Jupyter Notebook: The entire development workflow, including data loading, model building, training, evaluation, and predictions.
